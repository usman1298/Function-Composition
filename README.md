What is Function Composition?
Function composition is a technique where you combine two or more functions to produce a new function. In simpler terms, the output of one function is passed as the input to another function. It's like assembling functions together, one after another, to perform complex transformations or calculations.


Why we Use Function Composition?
Function composition is useful because Instead of writing large, complex functions, you break down tasks into smaller, simpler functions. These smaller functions can be reused in different places.
Each function handles a single responsibility, so your code becomes more understandable. You can easily see how one function flows into another.

When to Use Function Composition?
If you have a series of actions that need to happen one after the other, you can compose those actions into a single function.
Instead of writing one big function that does many things, you can write smaller functions and compose them together.
